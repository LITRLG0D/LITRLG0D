- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LITRLG0D
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into anime, manga, vinyl records, reading books, and tinkering around in linux
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning web development through various free and paid content online. I find learning
the same topic from different people helps me compile my own understanding of how things work.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at my email formidablehost@proton.me or Twitter @litrlg0d
